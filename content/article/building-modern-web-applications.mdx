Modern web development has evolved significantly over the past few years. With the introduction of Next.js 14 and the App Router, building full-stack applications has become more streamlined and developer-friendly than ever before.

## Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides a robust foundation for building production-ready applications. It combines the best features of server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering to deliver exceptional performance and user experience.

## Getting Started

Let's begin by setting up a new Next.js project with TypeScript support. The following command will create a new project with all the necessary configurations:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This command creates a new Next.js application with:

- TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- App Router enabled
- ESLint for code quality

### Project Structure

A typical Next.js project with App Router follows this structure:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── api/
├── components/
├── lib/
├── public/
└── package.json
```

## Key Features

### Server Components

Next.js 14 introduces React Server Components as the default. This allows you to write components that render on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle size sent to the client.

```typescript
// app/page.tsx - Server Component by default
export default async function HomePage() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const posts = await data.json();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to My Articles</h1>
      <PostList posts={posts} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Client Components

When you need interactivity, you can opt into client components using the `"use client"` directive:

```typescript
"use client";

import { useState } from 'react';

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

When building modern web applications, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Performance First**: Always measure and optimize for Core Web Vitals
2. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript to catch errors early
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure your application is usable by everyone
4. **SEO Optimization**: Leverage server-side rendering for better search rankings
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build features that work without JavaScript first

### Code Organization

Organize your code into logical modules:

```typescript
// lib/utils.ts
export function formatDate(date: Date): string {
  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", {
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
  }).format(date);
}

// lib/api.ts
export async function fetchPosts() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts");
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch posts");
  }
  return response.json();
}
```

## Deployment

Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms. Vercel, the creators of Next.js, offers the most seamless deployment experience:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository in Vercel
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy with a single click

The build process automatically optimizes your application for production, including:

- Code splitting and tree shaking
- Image optimization
- Static asset compression
- Edge caching configuration

## Conclusion

Building modern web applications requires understanding the trade-offs between different rendering strategies and choosing the right tools for your specific needs. Next.js 14 with TypeScript provides a solid foundation that scales from small projects to large enterprise applications.

By following the practices outlined in this guide, you'll be well-equipped to build performant, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications that stand the test of time.
